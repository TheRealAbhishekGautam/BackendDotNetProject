// All of your connection strigs and secret keys will be inside here like the database connections with the login credentials (username, password).
// We will have different appsettings file with the diff-diff environments and the enviromnet which will be declared inside the launchsettings.json file,
// the same appsettings file will be used. For eg. in the launchsettings.json file, instead of "ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT": "Development", "ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT": "Production"
// is declared then appsettings.production.json will be used, it's not there currently we have to add that in case required.
